**Event Definition**

Based on your query, an event can be defined as a specific occurrence within a system or network that triggers a reaction or response. It is often used to describe the activation of a particular process or action.

**Example Events**

Some examples of events include:

*   A user sending an email: This could trigger a notification to the recipient's email client.
*   A mouse click: This can initiate a GUI (Graphical User Interface) interaction with the application.
*   A firewall allowing a connection request: This event may lead to the establishment of a secure network connection.

**Event Characteristics**

Events typically have certain characteristics that define them. These include:

*   **Trigger**: The event is triggered by an action or condition within the system.
*   **Reaction**: The event triggers a response or reaction from the system or network.
*   **Duration**: Events can be transient (short-lived) or persistent, depending on their nature.

**Event Types**

There are different types of events that occur in various contexts:

*   System events: These occur within a specific system and may include tasks like starting a service or loading an application.
*   Network events: These happen when there is communication between devices on a network.
*   User events: These occur when users interact with the system, such as logging in or sending data.

**Event Definition and Incident**

Based on your query, it appears that you are looking for clarification on the definition of events and incidents.

An **event** can be defined as a specific occurrence within a system or network that triggers a reaction or response. It is often used to describe the activation of a particular process or action.

In contrast, an **incident** is a type of event that has a negative consequence. Examples of incidents include:

*   System crashes
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data

Incidents can also occur due to external factors such as natural disasters or power failures.

It's worth noting that the term "event" is often used in different contexts, including IT and cybersecurity, where it refers to a specific occurrence within a system or network. In this context, events are often triggered by an action or condition within the system and can lead to a reaction or response.

**Key Differences**

To summarize, the key differences between events and incidents are:

*   **Consequence**: Events can be positive or negative, while incidents always have a negative consequence.
*   **Trigger**: Both events and incidents are triggered by an action or condition within the system.
*   **Reaction**: While both events and incidents trigger a reaction, incidents often lead to more severe consequences.

I hope this helps clarify the distinction between events and incidents. Let me know if you have any further questions!

There is no single definition for what an IT security incident is, and therefore it varies between organizations. We define an IT security incident as an event with a clear intent to cause harm that is performed against a computer system. Examples of incidents are:

Data theft
Funds theft
Unauthorized access to data
Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools

Other types of incidents, such as those caused by malicious insiders, availability issues, and loss of intellectual property, also fall within the scope of incident handling. A comprehensive incident handling plan should address various types of incidents and provide appropriate measures to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from them to restore normal business operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Incident handling has two main activities, which are `investigating` and `recovering`. The investigation aims to:

- Discover the initial 'patient zero' victim and create an (ongoing if still active) incident timeline
- Determine what tools and malware the adversary used
- Document the compromised systems and what the adversary has done

Following the investigation, the recovery activity involves creating and implementing a recovery plan. When the plan is implemented, the business should resume normal business operations, if the incident caused any disruptions.

When an incident is fully handled, a report is issued that details the cause and cost of the incident. Additionally, "lessons learned" activities are performed, among others, to understand what the organization should do to prevent incidents of similar type from occurring again.

There are a few widely recognized endpoint hardening standards by now, with CIS and Microsoft baselines being the most popular, and these should really be the building blocks for your organization's hardening baselines. Some highly important actions (that actually work) to note and do something about are:

Based on the provided knowledge, there are several widely recognized endpoint hardening standards that can serve as a foundation for an organization's hardening baselines. Two of the most popular and widely adopted standards are:

1.  **CIS (Center for Internet Security) Baseline**: This is a comprehensive set of security controls and guidelines developed by the Center for Internet Security. It provides a framework for endpoint hardening, including recommendations for configuring operating systems, applications, and network settings.
2.  **Microsoft Baseline**: Microsoft has also published a set of baseline security configurations for its operating systems and applications. These baselines provide a starting point for organizations to harden their endpoints against common vulnerabilities.

Both the CIS and Microsoft baselines offer valuable guidance on endpoint hardening best practices. However, it's essential to note that each organization may have unique requirements and constraints that necessitate customizing these standards to meet specific needs.

Some key actions that can be taken to improve endpoint hardening include:

*   Implementing a robust security configuration for operating systems and applications
*   Enforcing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
*   Configuring network settings to limit access to sensitive resources
*   Keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches

Network segmentation is a powerful technique to avoid having a breach spread across the entire organization. Business-critical systems must be isolated, and connections should be allowed only as the business requires. Internal resources should really not be facing the Internet directly (unless placed in a DMZ).

Additionally, when speaking of network protection you should consider IDS/IPS systems. Their power really shines when SSL/TLS interception is performed so that they can identify malicious traffic based on content on the wire and not based on reputation of IP addresses, which is a traditional and very inefficient way of detecting malicious traffic.

Additionally, ensure that only organization-approved devices can get on the network. Solutions such as 802.1x can be utilized to reduce the risk of bring your own device (BYOD) or malicious devices connecting to the corporate network. If you are a cloud-only company using, for example, Azure/Azure AD, then you can achieve similar protection with Conditional Access policies that will allow access to organization resources only if you are connecting from a company-managed device.

At this point in time, stealing privileged user credentials is the most common escalation path in Active Directory environments. Additionally, a common mistake is that admin users either have a weak (but often complex) password or a shared password with their regular user account (which can be obtained via multiple attack vectors such as keylogging). For reference, a weak but complex password is "Password1!". It includes uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters, but despite this, it's easily predictable and can be found in many password lists that adversaries employ in their attacks. It is recommended to teach employees to use pass phrases because they are harder to guess and difficult to brute force. An example of a password phrase that is easy to remember yet long and complex is "i LIK3 my coffeE warm". If one knows a second language, they can mix up words from multiple languages for additional protection.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is another identity-protecting solution that should be implemented at least for any type of administrative access to **ALL** applications and devices.

Here are the bullet points summarizing the information:

*   Stealing privileged user credentials is a common escalation path in Active Directory environments.
*   Admin users often have weak or shared passwords, which can be easily obtained through various attack vectors.
*   Weak but complex passwords, such as "Password1!", are vulnerable to prediction and brute-force attacks despite their complexity.
*   Teaching employees to use passphrases is recommended for additional protection. Passphrases like "i LIK3 my coffeE warm" are easy to remember yet long and complex.
*   Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) at least for administrative access to all applications and devices is an effective way to protect identities.

These bullet points highlight the importance of implementing robust identity protection measures, such as strong passwords and MFA, to prevent common security threats in Active Directory environments.

Perform continuous vulnerability scans of your environment and remediate at least the "high" and "critical" vulnerabilities that are discovered. While the scanning can be automated, the fixes usually require manual involvement. If you can't apply patches for some reason, definitely segment the systems that are vulnerable!
